Program Description: This is a program that emulates the console project of the same name that we did during the coding combine. It's an API program that takes in two number inputs from the user, and returns a message that informs the user whether the numbers are larger than, smaller than, or equal to each other.

Peer Review By: Mark A Ramirez -- The program works and can even take decimals as the input which is very nice much expected from ken.

How To Instuctions:
1) Load the program into VSCode.
2) Start Debugging.
3) Copy Local Host URL from the console (e.g. "http://localhost:5264")
4) Open Postman program and paste the copied URL into a new workspace, with the "GET" input field.
5) Append the URL with "GreaterThanOrLessThan/GreaterThan/{num1}/{num2}"
6) Replace "{num1}" with the first number the user wants to compare, and {num2} with the second number the user wants to compare. Hit the "Send" button to the right of the input field.
